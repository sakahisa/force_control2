# Hack here: we cannot integrate qmake in the
# qt packages in the toolchains, because qmake will report
# a path that probably does not exists, so we instead
# look for moc and uic, and the copy-paste the macros from
# QT_USE_FILE ...

# Note: when cross-compiling, you should set QT_USE_QMAKE
# to false so that we do not use qmake from the system.
